      a. How did you unit test it? -> created the project with spring initialzr, added spring web component, 
        this includes junit tests. Project is also prepared to use restful api later
          
      b. How did you optimize the code for maintainability? -> used super class Animal and used interface classes
        for different behaviors, type and sounds as I progress.

       b. How is the rooster related to the chicken? -> extended chicken class
       c. Can you think of other ways to model a rooster without using inheritance? -> by having its own methods
         not inheriting from the interfaces i made.
